1 for performance(throughput and time delay), if more shcedule and switch  between kernel and process, the shcedule and switch comsumes cpu 
and time, and cache is prone to missing
2 for consistency
   2.1 if a interrupt processing flow is under process A context, then cpu is switched to process B, and another interrupt occurs and is processed under B, how the consistency?
   2.2 if switching is performed in the middle of processing of a interupt, it is difficult to synchronize.so switching can only exist between 2 interrputs
3 for  interrupt processing in kernel thread, thers is a problem, how scheduling guarantee kernel thread's priority?
